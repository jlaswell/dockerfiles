# dockerfiles

Here's a collection of containers that I find myself needing intermittently.

Most of these help to facilitate one-liners during those situations where "it
would be nice to have" something at the ready.

## Contributing

Feel free to send Pull Requests for any additions, fixes, or refactor you think
are worthwhile. Currently, most of these are built via automated builds on
Docker Hub, so once your Pull Request is in master, any existing containers will
be updated.
